/* Function Programming it just like bread and butter for React as i know and function as first class citizen why
after 2 years of experience you'll not write features,you'll writing your own code,own function,your own error handling framework,api's, your logging framework on frontend,some abstraction on state management not only features base if ther is card if i click the state should be change. so how it helps us see fp*/

/* Declarative Programming in js especiallly react uses ....

remember in vanila js we used to do thing .getElementById .innerhtml but with react you've never have to do such thing bcz we have seen how react abstract away DOM Creation given the this react library comes form function Programming..instead of saying how it should work say what should happen that's mantra
-and as we all fp is larger part of Programming
-why Declarative p : bcz it takes care all dom manipulation u'r innerhtml,innerText

/* why function Programming(FP):
-Firstly it does not depend on global variable so due to that less bugs face 
-Easier to understand and read ...
-more code reuce (becz everything within small function and component)
-super easy to test

/*ü§î How to do functional Programming ? see below The concept of ü§îimmutibility
what does it mean?? 
-it do not change any data Always return a new copy
Note: function argument are refference to actual data in JS
-Question‚ùì‚ùì: How does it happen Take an object with your mother's name and your age:
Now,Create an obj for your sibling(e.g tanvi) by age difference by 4 from into your age*/

console.log( sourabh === mrunal );

// create a copy of sourabh (avoid)
mrunal = sourabh; //it create a refference not copy itself
console.log( "mrunal age", mrunal );
mrunal.age = sourabh.age - 4;
console.log( "Mrunal Age Updated", mrunal );
// This is anothr way to change age but it won't help us it show inconcitency because it chane value of sourabh see below e.g. mrunal age is Updated but along with sourabh also Updated we didn't want this we want immutibility(unchange) this copy didn't work
console.log( "Sourabh's Age Updated", sourabh );

// Question‚ùì‚ùì: take an arry with 5 color create another arry by adding two color on it
